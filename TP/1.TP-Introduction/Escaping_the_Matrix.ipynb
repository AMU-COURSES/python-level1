    "# Escape from the Matrix\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to **Escape from the Matrix**, a text-based adventure game where you must navigate a simulated world, collect resources, and avoid obstacles to escape. \n",
    "This project will introduce you to **Python fundamentals**, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Variables and data types\n",
    "- Control structures (loops, conditionals)\n",
    "- Functions and modular programming\n",
    "- Using lists and dictionaries to manage data\n",
    "- Writing structured, reusable code\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this part, you'll implement **basic movement and an inventory system**, creating the foundation for the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions:\n",
    "1. Implement the functions `display_world()`, `move_player(direction)`, and `collect_item(position)`.\n",
    "2. Run `display_world()` to see the initial world state.\n",
    "3. Move using `move_player('up')`, `move_player('down')`, `move_player('left')`, or `move_player('right')`.\n",
    "4. Collect items using `collect_item('position')`.\n",
    "5. Experiment with different movement and inventory operations.\n",
    "6. Once you are confident, **move everything into a Python file (`game.py`) and import it in the notebook**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Task:\n",
    "- Create a new Python file: `game.py`\n",
    "- Copy all functions and variables into `game.py`\n",
    "- Import and test them in the notebook:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from game import move_player, collect_item, display_world\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Outcome:\n",
    "- The player should move within the grid.\n",
    "- The inventory system should store collected items as a dictionary `{item_name: quantity}`.\n",
    "- Everything should be reusable from `game.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Have fun!"
