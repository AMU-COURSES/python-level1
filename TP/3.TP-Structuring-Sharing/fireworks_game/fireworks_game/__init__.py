# no need to put anything here
# this file is just to make the folder a package
# so that we can import the module in the folder
# by using the folder name as the module name
# e.g. import fireworks_game

# could be used to import set some particular variables or import some particular functions...absolutely anything
#__all__ = ["fireworks", "game"]
#__version__ = "1.0.0"
