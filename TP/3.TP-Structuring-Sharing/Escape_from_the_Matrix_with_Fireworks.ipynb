    "## Exercise: Building a Python Module for the Fireworks Game\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "In this exercise, you will refactor, structure, and package your game properly, making it modular, testable, and shareable. You will:\n",
    "1. **Refactor** the existing code to eliminate global variables using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).\n",
    "2. **Modify the game** to import and run the fireworks simulation upon winning.\n",
    "3. **Review and enhance documentation** by adding docstrings and doctests.\n",
    "4. **Package your project** into a Python module using `pyproject.toml`.\n",
    "5. **Publish your project** on a code hosting platform (GitHub recommended).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "#### Step 1: Refactor Code to Avoid Global Variables\n",
    "- Convert the existing `game.py` and `fireworks.py` scripts into classes.\n",
    "- Ensure all game and simulation state variables are encapsulated inside class attributes.\n",
    "- Use instance methods instead of modifying global variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Modify Game to Run Fireworks at the End\n",
    "- Change key item: now we have fireworks, why would we use a key ;p ?\n",
    "- Update `game.py` to **import** `FireworksSimulation` from `fireworks.py`.\n",
    "- Modify the game logic so that **when the player wins, the fireworks animation starts.**\n",
    "- Ensure the game still prints the winning message before launching the animation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Review Docstrings and Add Doctests\n",
    "- Ensure all functions and classes include **clear and concise docstrings**.\n",
    "- Use **doctests** to validate the functionality of key methods.\n",
    "- Run `python -m doctest game.py` to check for correctness.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4: Create a Python Package\n",
    "- Organize your files into a structured package:\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  fireworks_game/\n",
    "  â”‚â”€â”€ fireworks_game/\n",
    "  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py\n",
    "  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ game.py\n",
    "  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ fireworks.py\n",
    "  â”‚â”€â”€ pyproject.toml\n",
    "  â”‚â”€â”€ README.md\n",
    "  â”‚â”€â”€ main.py\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- Create `pyproject.toml` to define dependencies and metadata.\n",
    "- Install the package locally using `pip install -e .`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 5: Share Your Project on a Code Hosting Platform\n",
    "- Initialize a Git repository in your project folder:\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  git init\n",
    "  git add .\n",
    "  git commit -m \"Initial commit: Fireworks Game\"\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- Push your project to GitHub:\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/fireworks_game.git\n",
    "  git push -u origin main\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- Ensure your repository includes:\n",
    "  - **A README file** describing the project.\n",
    "  - **Installation instructions** using `pip`.\n",
    "  - **A sample execution command**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Bonus Challenges** ðŸš€\n",
    "1. **Improve modularity** by splitting the game into smaller components.\n",
    "2. **Create automated tests** using `pytest`.\n",
    "3. **Add command-line arguments** to allow users to configure grid size and number of fireworks.\n",
    "4. **Publish the package to PyPI** so others can install it via `pip install fireworks_game`.\n",
